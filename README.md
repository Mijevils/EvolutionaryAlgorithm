# EvolutionaryAlgorithm

Evolutionary algorithm trained to learn to solve sudokus. Once the 
code is run it will learn to complete sudokus over time. 

To run, save and run the script. It will print each generation of
sudokus with the numeric attempt. A representative sudoku for each
generation will also be printed.
